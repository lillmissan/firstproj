The unicorn is a legendary creature that has been described since antiquity as a beast with a single large,
pointed, spiraling horn projecting from its forehead. The unicorn was depicted in ancient seals of the
Indus Valley Civilization and was mentioned by the ancient Greeks in accounts of natural history by various writers,
including Ctesias, Strabo, Pliny the Younger, and Aelian.
